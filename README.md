Intervention Engine FHIR Server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/intervention-engine/fhir.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/intervention-engine/fhir)[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/intervention-engine/fhir?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/intervention-engine/fhir)
===================================================================================================================================================================

This project provides [HL7 FHIR DSTU2](http://hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/index.html) models and server components implemented in Go and using MongoDB as storage. This is a
library that can be embedded into other server applications. The library is not a complete implementation of FHIR, as features that are selected are driven by the
[Intervention Engine](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie), [eCQM Engine](https://github.com/mitre/ecqm), [Patient Matching Test Harness](https://github.com/mitre/ptmatch)
and [Synthetic Mass](https://github.com/synthetichealth/syntheticmass) projects.

Currently, this server library supports:

-	JSON representations of all resources
-	Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) operations
-	Conditional update and delete
-	Some but not all search features
	-	All defined resource-specific search parameters except composite types and contact (email/phone) searches
	-	Chained searches
	-	\_include and \_revinclude searches (*without* \_recurse)
-	Batch bundle uploads (POST, PUT, and DELETE entries)

Currently, this server does *not* support the following major features:

-	XML representations of resources
-	History (versions, etc.)
-	Extension of primitive types and resource sub-components

As mentioned above, this repository contains a library. It does not build into a stand alone application. If you would like to build a server application, please see [fhir-server project](https://github.com/mitre/fhir-server).

*NOTE: Most of the fhir source code is generated by the [fhir-golang-generator](https://github.com/intervention-engine/fhir-golang-generator). In most cases, updates to source code in the fhir repository need to be accompanied by corresponding updates in the fhir-golang-generator.*

Development
-----------

This project uses Go 1.7 and MongoDB. To test the library, first, install all of the dependencies:

```
$ go get -t ./...
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you should make sure that MongoDB is also running. The test suite
will create a `fhir-test` database in a local instance of MongoDB to execute some tests. You can then
run the test suite with the following:

```
$ go test ./...
```

Usage
-----

Users of this library should work with the [FHIRServer](https://godoc.org/github.com/intervention-engine/fhir/server#FHIRServer) struct. Web request
handlers in this library are implemented using [Gin](https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/).

Examples of usage can be found in the [server set up of the eCQM Engine](https://github.com/mitre/ecqm/blob/master/server.go) or the
[server set up of Intervention Engine](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie/blob/master/server.go).
